SolarTimes is a program to compute times of sunrise and sunset for any point on Earth,
written by [Harry Maybeck](http://vortex.plymouth.edu/harfac.html) in [AmigaBASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaBASIC).

Included here is a bare-bones (not anywhere near complete) AmigaBASIC interpreter in Haskell by [Michael Tolly](https://github.com/mtolly), intended only to run SolarTimes, although other programs are possible.

## SolarTimes

This program is a revised, corrected and amended program
by Harry Maybeck, Route 175, P.O. Box 62, Holderness, NH 03245
from various solar programs originally written by students,
High School teachers, University professors, Astronomers,
Pilots, airlines Flight Dispatchers and amateur and
professional Meteorologists. All programs had been placed
in the "PUBLIC DOMAIN".

Upon running these various programs,
numerous errors in program language, technical statements,
and mathematical constants and equations were brought to light.
The technical statements and the mathematical (astronomical)
constants and equations errors resulted in varying and
erroneous results. These technical and mathematical errors
were corrected using various accepted astronomy, navigation
and mathematics texts and tables.

The program language errors
resulted in unnecessary "crashes" while running the programs
using certain unordinary input (such as: Latitudes higher than
70 degrees, East Longitudes, South Latitudes, 0 (zero)
Longitude or Latitude, etc.). These program language errors were
corrected using "Basic" definitions and instructions found
in "AMIGA™, User Guides (Amiga Basic)" and "KIDS AND
THE AMIGA©", E. H. Carlson, COMPUTE!™ Publications, Inc.

It is hoped that this compilation of, and adjustments to, these
many programs will provide a better program for the many
AMIGA™ users who may have need of the times of Sunrise and
Sunset for "any place" on "any day".
